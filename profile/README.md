It can somehow represent me, beacause 
- I don't have thick hair. 😭
- My expression usually does not change much.

📅 *Today is the last day of 2021*

This is my first week learning programming.<br/>
I was quite confused sometime. There are always new errors！
Thank Google for saving me.

## **Hope I can do better next year!**
